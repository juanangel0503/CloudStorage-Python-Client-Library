## Security

Security is taken seriously for this software project and all source code repositories.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them through the security reporting system.

If you prefer to submit without logging in, please use the security reporting system. If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the security response center PGP key page.

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up to ensure your original message was received. 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award.

## Preferred Languages
